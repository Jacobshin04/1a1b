# 1a1b Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This is the first game I developed using **C++ in a Linux Ubuntu environment**!  

<br>

**1a1b** is a two-player number guessing game where players try to guess each otherâ€™s 4-digit secret number. The game provides hints after each guess using 'a' and 'b':

- **'a'** indicates that both the number and its position are correct.
- **'b'** indicates that the number is correct but in the wrong position.

<br>

Players continue guessing until one correctly identifies the opponentâ€™s number.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with a **"1a1b" background screen**.

2. Each player enters their **name** and **4-digit secret number**.

3. Players take turns guessing the opponent's number.
4. After each guess, the program provides hints:
   - **Example:**  
     - Jacobâ€™s secret number: **1234**  
     - Vernessaâ€™s secret number: **5678**

   **Turn 1**
     - Jacob guesses **8765** â†’ **0a 4b** (all digits correct but misplaced)  
     - Vernessa guesses **1256** â†’ **2a 0b** (two digits correct in the right place)
    
   **Turn 2**
     - Jacob guesses **5679** â†’ **3a 0b** (three digits correct in the right place)  
     - Vernessa guesses **5687** â†’ **0a 0b** (all numbers incorrect)

6. The game continues until a player guesses the correct number.
